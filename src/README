1. How to run the program?

- The program contains multiple .java files, so you'll need to compile all of them first.
- After that, you'll run the TabbedPaneGUI.java. 
It will launch a Java application and a GUI will show up. 
- You may want to run this program in Eclipse. 
If so, you'll need to make sure that the Execution Environment is JavaSE-1.8,
and the Compiler compliance level is 1.8. 
Otherwise, they wouldn't be compatible and the Java application wouldn't be able to launched.
You won't have to compile all individual files if you run the program in Eclipse. 

2. How to use the program?

- On the GUI, there will be 3 tabs at the top, each tab representing a data structure. 
By clicking each tab, you'll switch to a different data structure. 
- On each tab, there will be some buttons on the right,
and you can click them and follow whatever instructions you are given on the top of the tab,
in order to manipulate the data structure with its given methods.
- For Graph only, there will be a textbox on the left next to the buttons where the console output will show. 
It is built so that you can read the results of traversal algorithms in the textbox right on the GUI,
instead of having to read them from the console.
